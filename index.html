      	<div class="entry_summary">What you’ll experience today may ring a bell, as we already featured something similar (yet not as good) in the past. But let me first explain what all the fuss is about:
On your right you can see an animated gif featuring a rotating array of blue crosses and 3 yellow dots. Your single assignment for today is to fixate on the centre and just focus on the flashy green spot. Note that the yellow dots have disappeared after a while – either one by one, or in pairs simultaneously. At one point they even start reappearing randomly!
So where’s the illusion, you may ask? Well, the beauty is that all of the three yellow dots are continuously present on the screen! This effect already got its name, and is called “Motion Induced Blindness”, or MIB in short.
While steady fixation favours disappearance, blinks or gaze shifts induce reappearance. All in all what we have here is reminiscent of the Troxler effect, but much stronger and more resistant to residual eye movements.
What happens if you focus your sight on one of the yellow dots, instead? Think this would also work with different colors? How about different elements and movement? Anyone willing to make a different kind of animation and test it out? Be sure to share your example and results with rest of us! BTW, click on the animation above to see it in higher-res! There you may find few more versions of this optical illusion as well..

      	<div class="entry_title">Schizophrenia Test</div>
      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Few years ago, researches from the London University discovered that schizophrenics are not that easily fooled by visual illusions. Even though their illness sometimes makes it difficult for them to distinguish fact from fiction, the study showed that they can see right through some optical illusions. What is so interesting about this finding is that it helps bolster one interpretation of this mental illness – that it may be due to a general inability to interpret sensory information in its proper context.

We often think of people with schizophrenia as not seeing the world the way it really is – for example, during hallucinations – but we have shown that sometimes their vision can be more accurate than non-sufferers – Dr. Steven Dakin, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology

How Was The Test Conducted

Which one of the surrounding shapes matches the central circle in level of contrast?

Volunteers were shown high-contrast black and white patterned images, with sections altered so that the level of contrast is much lower. They were then asked effectively to match the contrast of the altered section to its twin in a line up of otherwise identical shapes.
Schizophrenics find this task relatively easy, because their brain takes no account of the surrounding information when judging the level of contrast in the altered section. Non-schizophrenic brains, however, make relative judgments about the altered section, because of the surrounding higher contrast pattern.
The results were startling: 12 of the 15 schizophrenic observers were more accurate than the most-accurate member of the control group. The illusion is pretty substantial, but the schizophrenics were almost completely immune to its effect.
Though it’s till early, the authors hope their study might have some diagnostic value. Existing criteria for schizophrenia diagnosis tend to be subjective, and is based on interviews, but this study might be a good step towards more objective diagnostics one day.
The Explanation
To normal eyes, exampled background makes the central disk appear slightly greyer than it actually is. The researchers then assessed the subjects’ perception, showing them a series of disks of increasing grayness. For each disk, the observer had to guess whether the patch was of more or less contrast than the original image.

Dr Steven Dakin, of the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, explained: “Normally, contextual processes in the brain help us to focus on what’s relevant and stop our brains being overwhelmed with information. This process seems to be less effective in the schizophrenic brain, possibly due to insufficient inhibition – that is, the process by which cells in the brain switch each other off.”
He suggests that if this is part of a more general problem in dealing with information about context, it could explain why many schizophrenics misinterpret people’s actions, and can feel persecuted.

      	<div class="entry_summary">While we do a lot of skull illusions, few seem as romantic and touching as these three. In fact, Vurdlak already posted one by artist Karl Kwasny, who did the first and last ones in this post. I have to admit, I am attracted to Kwasny’s art for the very same reason Vurdlak is – the clean lines with sweet imagery make them hard to ignore, especially when paired with a spooky poem, like the one accompanying Karl’s Sisters illusion:


You’d better watch your footing
as the ground’s like thickened cream
there’s an awful secret
waiting down beside the stream

This next illusion was done by DeviantArt user MelloLover. While it might not come with a lovely poem like the one above, the artwork itself, adorned with the title Some of Us Change is simply beautiful. Everything about this work seems to invoke a story of dying love and a heartache…
Lastly, another impressive work by Karl Kwasny, even though not having a poem attached to it, is still beautiful and tragic as it shows the two boys back to back against a full moon.
What do you guys think? Do these works make you feel for lost loves and deceased loved ones? Or are they too sugary-sweet and tragic to swallow?

      	<div class="entry_summary">Our eyes seem to have a traced pattern depending on what we look at, particularly when it comes to landscape images. That’s why these Tree, Line images by Zander Olsen are so fascinating. They remind us that we tend to take things sitting under the horizon line for granted when looking at landscapes. The Welsh artist creates his works by wrapping trees with a white material that, when viewed from the exact right angle, hide the trunk between the natural horizon line and the skyline, or in some case,  between the tree’s roots and the natural horizon. In the process, he ends up whiting out the trees that make up the foreground of certain parts of the image.
The result might not technically be an illusion by the traditional sense, but it certainly makes the viewer do a double take and consider just how the mind tends to process these views, which is something any good illusion should be doing anyway.
What do you guys think, do these qualify for the site? Not optical-illusory enough? If not, do you at least like the idea behind the artwork? I certainly did!

      	<div class="entry_summary">Artist Cecilia Paredes could easily be labeled as the “female Liu Bolin,” but to do so would only marginalize the talent of the Peruvian painter whose detailed, patterned paintings are worthy of being respected on their own merits. Besides, the simple fact that she tends to leave her chestnut brown hair and dark brown eyes visible in so many of her pictures, means that she doesn’t really want to hide away completely like Bolin tends to do. Instead, the artist says that she creates her camouflaged artwork as part of her “quest of belonging.”


“The theme,” she explains, ” is re-location after displacement and migration and how one has to adjust in order to belong.” While most of us haven’t gone through the difficulties of migration, the idea of trying to change ourselves in order to fit in is something we can all relate to, even if only from those awkward teen years.
And that’s precisely why Paredes’ art works so well. While they do tend to hide most of the subject, they still show enough of the person underneath, reminding us that no mater how hard we try to fit in, our true selves will always shine out to some extent.
Of course, it’s also a reminder than in art, as well as life, those people that truly want to be seen must stop being wallflowers at some point and dare to step out into the limelight!

Just like the ones presented below. In my opinion, these are just cool beyond words. Can you imagine walking around a gallery space looking soley at the beautiful objects, when all of a sudden you reach the position where the lights and objects collide to form a shadow of words?
After you’ve checked both #Fred Eerdekens and #Shadow tags, you’ll have a pretty good insight to proceed with what I have prepared for you today.  Wires, metal, junk, trees… it’s just a portion of material Fred uses to come up with his creations. Here are some of the more prominent works done by this artists. And if all of this still isn’t enough for you, you are welcome to browse through the attached gallery at the bottom of this post.

It’s not that I don’t like them, it’s just that I think the motive is a bit over-exploited, and rarely innovative nowadays. Most of the things that were there to be said about these, I think we already mentioned. Check the #Skulls category to see what I mean.
On the other hand, #Billboard illusions are my favorite type of illusions. When an agency produces a professional poster using a well known illusion motive, there is a great chance the results will be eye-captivating.
Skull motive is just what these agencies had in mind when they were asked to produce captivating campaigns for public service announcements. AIDS, smoking, drug use.. these are just some of the issues for which such posters were crafted.
Check the featured gallery below, and see what I have prepared for you today. Hope you like them all, and hopefully you’ll learn something from them! My personal favorite was the helmet one immediately below.
SUVA – Accident Prevention
Suva, Switzerland’s independent, non-profit company opened its doors as the Swiss Accident Insurance Fund way back in 1918. This add was done for them by Ruf Lanz ad agency. I saw the horrific Scream mask prior to bicycle helmet, which is probably what the agency intended in the first place.
Don’t let accidents end up in a nightmare: Wear a Helmet

AIDS Kills
The poster image plays with a series of paradoxes to capture the viewer’s curiosity and interest. There is a classic sign of danger, the skull, which depicts the perils of the AIDS and HIV virus. The paradox is in the series of nudes positioned to form the image of the skull. The aesthetics of the nude figures draws the attention of the viewer while the skull symbolizes the consequences of unprotected love making. This poster was done by an agency TBWA/Paris, and was inspired by a photograph made by Philippe Halsman in 1951.
Protect Yourself: The Only Way to Stop AIDS Is You

Cocaine Kills
When you see this ad for the first time, your eyes probably automatically see a skull covered in blood first. After studying the image for a bit longer, you realize the “skull” was actually a nose, and that there is a person present in the image as well. By using a skull motive, this ad smartly indicates that the consequence of drug use will be death. By using black as a background, agency achieves the effect of making the poster look dark and evil.

MADD – Stop drunk driving
The mission of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) is to stop drunk driving and support the victims of this violent crime. They usually come up with smart looking posters, just like this optical illusion skull ad below.
Saying goodbye once is hard enough

Smoking Kills
Just another skull-ash-motive optical illusion done by an unknown artist. This motive is very popular among public service ads, when smoking issues are brought up.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">What can you do with a few hundred spools of thread in various colors? If you’re Devorah Sperber you can make amazing upside down portraits of pop culture icons and classical artworks that can only really be seen correctly with a large convex lens that helps squish the image together and flips it right side up again for your viewing pleasure.
Technically, the works could also be seen from a distance so your eyes would be able to view the spools as thread as mere color pigments instead of bulky objects, but unlike similar large-scale works by other artists, Sperber intentionally creates her designs for the use of the convex lens, which flips images. That means that if you backed up far enough to see the colors turn into their intended subjects, the image would still be upside down.
Of course, like any true artist, Sperber’s methods vary from piece to piece. She occasionally will create designs that are right side up and she has been known to use other materials besides thread.
For example, in these Star Trek images, she shied away from thread spools and instead turned to tiny faceted beads. This technique works particularly well on the members of the U.S.S. enterprise as it replicates the way the characters looked when they were being teleported (or “beamed”) to or from the ship.
I know some people on the site have a rather limited definition of illusions, but for those that are more open to artistic takes on our basic methods of perception, what do you think of Devorah’s work?
Are her anamorphic creations illusionish enough? And if you don’t consider them illusions, do you at least enjoy her art?

      	<div class="entry_summary">First of all let me apologize for lack of update yesterday and on the day before. I just hope today’s photo will make up for the gap.
Look how the road on your right appears warped! It kind of reminds me of those surreal-melted bridges and roads that can be found all over Google Earth. Yet the “imperfections” weren’t caused by some automatic 3D computing and modeling that Google applies to it’s aerial imagery. No, this is just an ordinary aerial shot, and the warping is just an illusion caused by the super-wide tollgate that widens the road with enough tollbooths to accept and process all the heavy traffic.
It just seems so surreal to me. Even after understanding the illusion, I still have trouble seeing the road as an ordinary highway widened at it’s belly. I can’t stop thinking all those vehicles would tip over and fall, once they surpass the tollbooth’s “cliff edge”… How about you? Did you find it impressive?
Oh, I almost forgot: Facebook made an update to our channel to comply with its new Timeline standard. Go ahead, check it out – there are many nice illusions posted to it daily!

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Illusions done by Akiyoshi Kitaoka, a Japanese professor of psychology have always been worthy of our attention. So what has he been up to lately? Let’s see if his “Evening Dusk” optical illusion brings something new to the table! Below shapes and figures give an illusion where it appears that the amount of light surrounding them is different compared to their insides. But there is another serious effect happening here – one messing with our brains and sight! Take a look at this figure below, before we proceed:

When light is bright, your eye constricts!

It probably gave you an impression that it’s much brighter in it’s center, compared to white background surrounding it’s outer edges. It also makes you believe that the amount of light inside it is much greater than it actually is, thus making your eyes constrict!
Why do our eyes constrict?
When light is bright, your eye constricts by contracting or dilating your pupils. It does this to protect itself from being damaged. What’s interesting is that scientists used to think this very fast reaction occurred completely as an automatic reflex, and that our higher brain wasn’t used.
If you compare the above figure with the below one, and if you measured the actual amount of light they both give off, you would quickly discover that the same amount of light is reaching your eyes. It’s just that your brain interprets the top image as brighter. But what’s really strange is that your eye alone thinks the top one is brighter, too.

The inside space surrounded by "petals" appears to be darker than the outer space!

Our eyes will actually constrict as a reflex when they’re looking at the first image, meaning that they constrict when the brighter light is only an illusion! This means our eyes and brain are reacting to what we think we see, rather than what’s really there! Researchers Bruno Laeng and Tor Endestad explain in their research that our brain and sensory organs react with each other much more than we realize. What they believe, is that we create illusions because they help us protect ourselves from possible future events.
See the below picture containing both shapes next to each other. Who would guess both of their insides were equal in brightness and amount of light they cast!

Which figure's center is brighter?

Hope you learned something new today! Before I log-out, let me show you another example. Pretty much same effect happens below:

      	<div class="entry_summary">How many red balls can you count in this photo below? Take a brief moment and count before you continue. Did you say there were five red balls? Are you absolutely positively certain? Recount again. Can you see another? Look closer. Are you positive there are only five balls? The longer you look at the photo and try to figure it out, the more surprised you’ll be when I reveal the optical illusion it hides. How about this for a hint! Didn’t help? How about another hint… Admit it, you never thought the answer was right there in front of your eyes the whole time. If you enjoy this type of optical illusions, be sure to head over and watch the Awareness Test video. Thanks goes to Deceptology blog for bringing this to my attention!

Notice how many red balls are there in this photo?

      	<div class="entry_summary">I’ll admit it, this Sima Pashtun rug illusion, created by Mauricio Lara and Sebastián Lara, took me a little while to see. At first I thought it was just supposed to look like it was melting or stretched out, but once I saw the crazy extra dimension it adds to the floor, I couldn’t unsee the illusion.
While you might hope that it looks even more like quicksand with someone standing on it, the result is, unfortunately, quite the opposite – showing exactly how flat the rug really is. In fact, the rug is quite anamorphic being as how the illusion really only works when viewed from the proper angle without anyone standing on it to interfere with the design.
As for how the rug itself was created: well, it may look totally unique, but it’s actually quite traditional. In fact, the technique used to weave this design was a 3,000 year old Tibetan style. I guess it’s true that everything old will become new again at some point…

David Macdonald’s modern attempt even managed to surpass the original in internet popularity, and Megafon’s promotional poster went even further! But if you ask me, I’m almost certain none of this would ever exist if M.C. Escher decided to keep his portfolio away from public. And as it goes with famous works of art, they are recreated in LEGO more often than not. It was only a matter of time before artists like Brixie63 of Flickr recreated the “Terrace” using nothing but LEGO.
