      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Fred Eerdekens is a Belgian artist we’ve featured multiple times in the past. What we have learned by now, is that he is most famous for his breathtaking installations that use light and very purposely placed objects to create typographic spaces. Just like the ones presented below. In my opinion, these are just cool beyond words. Can you imagine walking around a gallery space looking soley at the beautiful objects, when all of a sudden you reach the position where the lights and objects collide to form a shadow of words?
After you’ve checked both #Fred Eerdekens and #Shadow tags, you’ll have a pretty good insight to proceed with what I have prepared for you today.  Wires, metal, junk, trees… it’s just a portion of material Fred uses to come up with his creations. Here are some of the more prominent works done by this artists. And if all of this still isn’t enough for you, you are welcome to browse through the attached gallery at the bottom of this post. Which one is your favorite? Can you make out all of the words and letters produced by shadows? How about those is dutch?

      	<div class="entry_summary">When I stumble across skull optical illusions, I’m very picky when deciding which ones deserve to be featured on Mighty Optical Illusions homepage. It’s not that I don’t like them, it’s just that I think the motive is a bit over-exploited, and rarely innovative nowadays. Most of the things that were there to be said about these, I think we already mentioned. Check the #Skulls category to see what I mean.
On the other hand, #Billboard illusions are my favorite type of illusions. When an agency produces a professional poster using a well known illusion motive, there is a great chance the results will be eye-captivating.
Skull motive is just what these agencies had in mind when they were asked to produce captivating campaigns for public service announcements. AIDS, smoking, drug use.. these are just some of the issues for which such posters were crafted.
Check the featured gallery below, and see what I have prepared for you today. Hope you like them all, and hopefully you’ll learn something from them! My personal favorite was the helmet one immediately below.
SUVA – Accident Prevention
Suva, Switzerland’s independent, non-profit company opened its doors as the Swiss Accident Insurance Fund way back in 1918. This add was done for them by Ruf Lanz ad agency. I saw the horrific Scream mask prior to bicycle helmet, which is probably what the agency intended in the first place.
Don’t let accidents end up in a nightmare: Wear a Helmet

AIDS Kills
The poster image plays with a series of paradoxes to capture the viewer’s curiosity and interest. There is a classic sign of danger, the skull, which depicts the perils of the AIDS and HIV virus. The paradox is in the series of nudes positioned to form the image of the skull. The aesthetics of the nude figures draws the attention of the viewer while the skull symbolizes the consequences of unprotected love making. This poster was done by an agency TBWA/Paris, and was inspired by a photograph made by Philippe Halsman in 1951.
Protect Yourself: The Only Way to Stop AIDS Is You

Cocaine Kills
When you see this ad for the first time, your eyes probably automatically see a skull covered in blood first. After studying the image for a bit longer, you realize the “skull” was actually a nose, and that there is a person present in the image as well. By using a skull motive, this ad smartly indicates that the consequence of drug use will be death. By using black as a background, agency achieves the effect of making the poster look dark and evil.

MADD – Stop drunk driving
The mission of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) is to stop drunk driving and support the victims of this violent crime. They usually come up with smart looking posters, just like this optical illusion skull ad below.
Saying goodbye once is hard enough

Smoking Kills
Just another skull-ash-motive optical illusion done by an unknown artist. This motive is very popular among public service ads, when smoking issues are brought up.

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Lenticular graffiti takes a special hand in that the artist cannot just select any old surface to apply this type of artwork. Instead, he or she must scout around, looking for a location that happens to be suitable for this specific type of poster application. That’s why lenticular illusions are much more common to be found in the UK than practically anywhere else – it’s just that they have by far most shutters and latticed sidings than other countries do.
To that end, English artist dr. d is one of the premiere artists when it comes to lenticular graffiti. Here is one of his artworks critiquing the country’s prison system (for those unaware, H.M.P. stands for “Her Majesty’s Prison). First see how they work when viewed straight on:
But see what happens when you walk down the street, approaching the artwork from opposite directions. The message completely transforms!

While some people critique this type of art as it doesn’t involve directly painting on the artist’s selected street canvas, the reality is that it still takes quite a bit of talent to create these works on a computer. Not to mention a whole lot necessary to print them out and apply outdoors, so the illusion actually works wherever it happens to be installed.

Dr. d has even faced enough of these criticisms that he has a fair response already prepared on his website:
If you’re making posters from scratch, then you’re going to use a stencil or turn to your computer, but you still have to get them up, and I’ve yet to find the ‘Control Alt Complete’ command on mine…


Like all art though, the interpretation eventually comes down to the viewer. So what do you guys think? Are these printed graffiti installations art, or something else?

The Dark Knight Rises Teaser Poster

Last summer I’ve showed you an early teaser for the upcoming Hollywood Batman sequel, titled “The Dark Knight Rises“. Now that we’re just few months from the movie being released, let me show you another illusory poster I’ve stumbled upon lately. Those of you familiar with the plot will probably see the illusion faster than the rest, but either way it works great.
Am not 100% certain whether this poster is part of the official campaign, or just some cool fan-art homage to the franchise. Still, you should be able to see both the main character and the villain present somewhere in it. I just hope you like it!
Oh, and need I mention that we’re just couple of fans away from our 30,000th Facebook fan? If you like this site, please help us share the buzz. You can contribute by mentioning us to your friends and family, as well as sharing our channel on FB!

Think it all started with the Little Green Dragon from our very beginnings, but I could be wrong. Einstein’s face illusion was as effective, and afterwards much more examples followed. One of my favorites was the “Janek’s Nuts” video. Check them all out once you finish viewing the video below!

Take his “Neon Heart illusion” for example – can you see the faint glow surrounding the heart? It might help if you squint your eyes a little. Well, I’m afraid the neon glow you perceived is just an illusion, and that the yellow unicolor background is same for each box in the grid. It’s just the part of the grid painted black that’s responsible for this. I think it has something to do with contrasts, but don’t take me for granted. BTW, the effect gets much stronger the more you shrink the image. If you wish, you can download our desktop widget (if you haven’t already) and see how it looks in the “Illusion of The Day” widget.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Elevators can be a scary place to be in, specially if something goes wrong. Since childhood, ideas of being trapped by an elevator, or a malfunction happening at the moment we use them, has given us nightmares. Still, I don’t think its that common that each time we step onto a lift, the prospect of dying crosses our minds. We know the odds are in our favor, so if something happens, it will probably happen to someone else, right?
Shoppers in London, however, were in for a frightening ride recently. The lift at the Southside Shopping Centre in Wandsworth, London, gave shoppers a true scare. The elevator had a realistic optical illusion painted, just like that Anti-smoking ceiling we featured before. This time the floor was done in a way to appear it was missing. As customers stepped onto the elevator, their hearts skipped a beat as they were surely in for a surprise. If this over-the-top PR stunt is only a preview of a new ride hitting the Alton Towers theme park next month, it sounds thrilling!

When shoppers called the lift, the door opened to reveal this deep, yawning lift-shaft, and even the most hardened adventurer could be permitted a small scream of terror – The Daily Mail
Artist Andrew Walker created this 3D illusion to promote a new ride called “Nemesis Sub-Terra” at the Alton Towers theme park. The ride opens on March 24, and when it does, it will take visitors on an underground journey through an elaborate network of caves. Supposedly, “it will be unlike anything seen before in the UK”. Let’s wait and see…

Have you guessed correctly? There is even an online tutorial posted on Istructables where you can learn how to make similar perspective illusions of your own! Check what one our fans, a well known Tattoo artist Greg “Grease” Lehman, did by himself! Hope you liked this video as much as I did…

On your right you may see a rotating wheel that seems to pulsate each time it aligns with the inner, star-shaped stationary object. You may also have noticed, that at the same time, the inner stationary shape seems to wiggle when the alignment occurs. Why is this happening, when it’s obvious that the inner shape is stationary, while the outer wheel’s rotation is perfectly smooth?
It turns out that the pulsations is caused by color assimilation, and the wiggling happens due to “ambiguous figure-ground segregation” (whatever this means), as Peter van der Helm discusses in his paper (2007).

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">We’ve featured the work of Kurt Wenner before, but not nearly enough given the amazing talent of the artist. In fact, in many cases, Wenner’s art appears to be even more realistic than many of the other 3D chalk artists we feature because he frequently opts to include a back wall into his works, giving them even more dimension. Take this installation at the Waterloo Station in London, for example. Sure the man on his couch watching television has a lot of depth, but by adding a truck full of 3D animals crashing through the wall, it’s easy to feel just as shocked as the man in the artwork.
Here’s another example incorporating a back wall to the artwork. Sure he could have stretched the piece over a long space of sidewalk to play with our perception, but by creating this ad for Celebrity Cruises with a back wall, the drawing looks right no mater what angle you view it from.
Of course, he doesn’t incorporate backdrops into artworks that don’t need them. In fact, adding a background to this reflecting pool illusion might actually distract from the amazing likeness of the actors portrayed in the sidewalk.
If you need further proof that Wenner is certainly one of the masters of his craft, consider the fact that he was the first 3D chalk artist to conceive of an interactive chalk drawing as seen in this photograph from 1987.
Zip-lining across a city street can be fun, but it’s nothing compared to flying across wild terrain. For those that don’t have the time or money to get away from it all though, Wenner offers a grand compromise with this gorgeous canyon advertising the beauty of wild British Columbia.
For more great works by Kurt Warner, don’t miss this piece in the Telegraph, or just visit his website.
