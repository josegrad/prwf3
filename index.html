<p>Sometimes when I’m <em>forced</em> to repeat myself (as it happens there is only a limited number of illusory effects and patterns out there), at least I try to wait before I find the next best thing. As our “Seemingly Animated” category is among the most popular ones, it wasn’t easy to find an illusion that could match or even beat our previous champ. Yet I think I have managed to do this with today’s “Anomalous Motion” illusion. What do you think of it? Credit goes to G. Sarcone, the author who created this.</p>

<p>I’m perfectly aware most of you would love to see entertaining and quality stuff posted more often. I keep struggling to maintain quality, which would be hard to accomplish if I’d concentrate solely on quantity. In plain words, it would be much easier for me to post repetitive stuff as well as some lower quality illusions to maintain regularity, but from my experience following the easier route rarely brings better results. New and refreshing stuff is hard to find whole by myself. This is where I also depend on your quality content submissions and discoveries. So don’t be a stranger! There’s a submit link right below in the footer, where it always stood. Oh, and don’t worry – I’m still fully dedicated to this blog and my dearest community!

<p>Apart from seeing the missing sections of these 4 dark disks as the sides of the square (some will even perceive the square as brighter than its surroundings), as well as perceiving the vague contour lines of a square that doesn’t actually exist, this picture holds another great optical illusion. When the brain sees an image like this, it interprets depth relationships to perceive the square as set on top of black disks – as a result, the inside of the square is perceived as being closer to your eyes than its surroundings, ultimately creating visual illusion that makes you think the area within the square is enlarged! How about that? This non-existent square becomes a magnifier magnifying the text behind it. This specially works for spacings above and below each word inside the rect. See it? More similar interactive examples can be found in this Mind Lab presentation. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Looking forward to hear what you think of this? I never saw tessellations coming to life before. Perhaps once, when I think about it. Think something similar was featured in the “Escher’s working space” video we featured few months ago. Have to check it again just to make sure…</p>

<p>Just like Trina and Ryan, who body-painted those hot motorcycles last week, Emma Hack came up with something even more peculiar! She imagined a car that had been involved in a small crash, then <em>built it</em> by painting and positioning 17 naked men and women down to the smallest detail. Recreating a “perfect car” perhaps wash’t doable after all, so she had to compromise imagining an after-crash vehicle, but never the less end-results are still amazing! BTW, did you know that Emma was responsible for most of the body-art featured in Gotye’s popular video “Somebody That I Used To Know”?</p>

You might make a honest mistake, thinking it’s one of his newer works, but it’s quite opposite in fact.

Aside from ships (motif this artist uses so often), there is another illusory transformation present. Can you see it? Where does one idea stops, another other begins… How about a hint ;D</p>

<p>So what do you get if you combine yoga, bodypaint and nude models? “Human Motorcycles” as it appears, at least this was the case with our latest post. Featured art installation is a culmination of collaboration between bodypaint artists Trina Merry and Ryan Berman, where resulting <em>motorcycles</em> will tour with the Progressive International Motorcycle Shows in the US. It took over three days to create all three of the human motorcycles (shown below), more precisely: Ducati sport bike, KTM dirt bike and Harley-Davidson cruiser. Watch the YouTube clip to see behind the scenes footage.</p>

The best things sometimes happen upon us unintentionally, and this is exactly what happened to Liammm when he decided that water circling the drain of his sink would make for a nice photographic subject. Some of our fans even suggested that the illusion is more pronounced when you’re looking at it’s thumbnail, via one of our widgets. Effect in place is called <em>Pareidolia</em>, just FYI.</p>

<p>Watch this circle jump to life as soon as you tilt your head, and move your eyes across the image. Does the circular middle section appear to separate from the rest of the figure? Does it appear to be at a different depth or even move? So what is going on around here? Well, Ouchi Illusion is not well understood. In one interpretation the vertical lines can be perceived as being on the same depth plane as the horizontal ones – a strictly two-dimensional image. Your visual sytem can interpret this image as 3D, where the vertical lines lie on a different depth plane than the horizontal ones. The circular contour therefore acts as an aperture. If the two differently orientated bars are perceived as being on different depth planes, then eye movements can cause induced motion. Thanks goes to Brian for discovering and submitting this optical illusion by prof. Akiyoshi Kitaoka.</p>
